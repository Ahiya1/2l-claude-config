# 2L Abandon Plan - Archive Current Plan and Rollback

Mark the current plan as abandoned and rollback to the end of the previous plan.

## Usage

```bash
/2l-abandon-plan
```

**Optional with reason:**
```bash
/2l-abandon-plan "Requirements changed - pivoting to mobile first"
```

---

## What This Does

Abandons the current plan and rolls back to the previous stable state:

1. Marks current plan as `ABANDONED` in config
2. Finds the last completed iteration of the previous plan
3. Rolls back code to that state
4. Sets previous plan as current
5. Preserves all git history

    echo "‚ùå Working directory has uncommitted changes."
    echo "Commit or stash first."
    exit 1
fi

# Read config
CONFIG_FILE=".2L/config.yaml"

if [ ! -f "$CONFIG_FILE" ]; then
    echo "‚ùå No 2L config found"
    exit 1

# Get current plan
CURRENT_PLAN=$(yq eval '.current_plan' $CONFIG_FILE)

## What Gets Updated

**Before abandonment:**
```yaml
current_plan: plan-2
global_iteration_counter: 5

plans:
  - plan_id: plan-1
    name: "Authentication System"
    status: COMPLETE

  - plan_id: plan-2
    name: "Payment Integration"
    status: IN_PROGRESS  # Current, will be abandoned
```

**After `/2l-abandon-plan "Requirements changed"`:**
```yaml
current_plan: plan-1  # Rolled back to previous
global_iteration_counter: 3  # Last iteration of plan-1

plans:
  - plan_id: plan-1
    name: "Authentication System"
    status: COMPLETE  # Now current again

  - plan_id: plan-2
    name: "Payment Integration"
    status: ABANDONED  # Abandoned
    abandoned_at: "2025-10-02T15:30:00"
    abandoned_reason: "Requirements changed"
```

---

## Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Requirements Pivot
```bash
# Midway through plan-2 (payments)
# Client says: "Actually, we need notifications first"

/2l-abandon-plan "Pivoting to notifications - payment deferred"

# Now at end of plan-1
# Create new plan for notifications

/2l-vision
# Interactive vision for notifications

/2l-plan
# Create notification plan

/2l-mvp
# Execute new plan-2 (notifications)
```

### Use Case 2: Technical Blockers
```bash
# plan-2 requires external API that's not ready yet

/2l-abandon-plan "External payment API not available"

# Revert to plan-1 completion
# Work on plan-3 instead (can be done independently)

/2l-vision
# Create plan-3 for other features
```

### Use Case 3: Approach Failed
```bash
# plan-2 approach isn't working
# Want to try completely different strategy

/2l-abandon-plan "Architecture approach not suitable"

# Back at plan-1
# Create fresh plan-2 with new approach

/2l-vision
# Design new approach

/2l-plan
/2l-mvp
```

---

## Recovery: Restoring Abandoned Plan

All abandoned plan work is preserved in git. To recover:

```bash
# Find commits from abandoned plan
git log --all --oneline | grep "plan-2"

# Output:
# abc1234 2L Iteration 5 (Plan plan-2)
# def5678 2L Iteration 4 (Plan plan-2)

# Checkout to recover
git checkout abc1234

# Review the code
# If you want to continue from here:

# 1. Update config to restore plan
# Edit .2L/config.yaml
# Change plan-2 from ABANDONED to IN_PROGRESS

# 2. Continue work
/2l-continue
```

---

## Difference from Rollback

| Command | Current Plan Status | Target |
|---------|---------------------|--------|
| `/2l-rollback 3` | Unchanged | Specific iteration |
| `/2l-rollback-to-plan plan-1` | Unchanged | End of specific plan |
| `/2l-abandon-plan` | Marked ABANDONED | End of previous plan |

**Key difference:** Abandon explicitly marks the plan as failed/cancelled, while rollback is just time travel.

---

## Error Handling

**If this is the first plan:**
```
‚ùå This is the first plan - cannot rollback to previous

Options:
  1. Continue with this plan: /2l-continue
  2. Start fresh: /2l-vision (creates new plan)
```

**If git is dirty:**
```
‚ùå Working directory has uncommitted changes.
Commit or stash first.
```

**If plan already abandoned:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  Plan is already abandoned
```

**If no active plan:**
```
‚ùå No active plan to abandon
```

---

## Integration with Other Commands

**After abandoning:**
```bash
/2l-status         # Shows previous plan as current
/2l-list-plans     # Shows abandoned plan in list
/2l-vision         # Create new plan from here
```

**To view abandoned plans:**
```bash
/2l-list-plans

# Output includes:
# plan-2 (ABANDONED) - Payment Integration
#   Abandoned: 2025-10-02
#   Reason: Requirements changed
```

---

## Prerequisites

- Clean git working directory
- Active plan exists
- At least one previous plan exists (can't abandon first plan)
- Previous plan has completed iterations

---

## Notes

- **Non-destructive:** All commits preserved in git
- **Recoverable:** Can checkout abandoned plan commits later
- **Semantic:** Marks plan as explicitly abandoned (not just rolled back)
- **Safe:** Validates state before proceeding

---

**Remember:** Abandonment is different from failure. It's a deliberate decision to stop pursuing a direction, not a bug or error.
