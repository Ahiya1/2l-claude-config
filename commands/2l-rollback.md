# 2L Rollback - Time Travel to Specific Iteration

Rollback the codebase to a specific iteration checkpoint using git tags.

## Usage

```bash
/2l-rollback <iteration-number>
```

**Example:**
```bash
/2l-rollback 3          # Rollback to iteration 3
/2l-rollback plan-2-5   # Rollback to plan-2, iteration 5
```

---

## What This Does

Rolls back your codebase to the state at the end of a specific iteration:

1. Validates git working directory is clean
2. Finds the git tag for the specified iteration
3. Checks out to that tag
4. Archives future iterations/plans in config
5. Updates `.2L/config.yaml` to reflect rolled-back state

---

## Safety Checks

Before rollback, the command validates:

### Check 1: Git is Clean
```bash
git status --porcelain
```

**If dirty:**
```
‚ùå Working directory has uncommitted changes.

Please commit or stash your changes first:
  git add .
  git commit -m "WIP: before rollback"

Or stash:
  git stash
```

**Must be clean to proceed.**

### Check 2: Iteration Exists
```bash
# Check if iteration has a git tag
git tag -l | grep "2l-plan-.*-iter-${ITERATION}"
```

**If not found:**
```
‚ùå Iteration ${ITERATION} not found.

Available iterations:
  1 (2l-plan-1-iter-1) - Foundation Setup
  2 (2l-plan-1-iter-2) - Core Features
  3 (2l-plan-1-iter-3) - User Authentication

Use: /2l-rollback <iteration-number>
```

### Check 3: Not Rolling Back to Current
```bash
# Check current iteration from config
if [ "$CURRENT_ITERATION" = "$TARGET_ITERATION" ]; then
    echo "Already at iteration $TARGET_ITERATION"
    exit 0
fi
```

---

## Iteration Number Formats

The command accepts multiple formats:

### Format 1: Global Iteration Number
```bash
/2l-rollback 5
```
Rolls back to global iteration 5 (across all plans).

### Format 2: Plan + Iteration
```bash
/2l-rollback plan-2-3
```
Rolls back to plan-2, iteration 3.

### Format 3: Tag Name
```bash
/2l-rollback 2l-plan-1-iter-2
```
Rolls back to specific git tag.

## What Gets Archived

When rolling back, future iterations are marked as `ARCHIVED` in config:

**Before rollback:**
```yaml
plans:
  - plan_id: plan-1
    iterations:
      - iteration_id: 1
        status: COMPLETE
      - iteration_id: 2
        status: COMPLETE
      - iteration_id: 3
        status: COMPLETE  # Rolling back to here
      - iteration_id: 4
        status: COMPLETE
```

**After `/2l-rollback 3`:**
```yaml
plans:
  - plan_id: plan-1
    iterations:
      - iteration_id: 1
        status: COMPLETE
      - iteration_id: 2
        status: COMPLETE
      - iteration_id: 3
        status: COMPLETE  # Current
      - iteration_id: 4
        status: ARCHIVED  # Archived
        archived_at: "2025-10-02T14:30:00"
        archived_reason: "Rollback to iteration 3"
        git_commit: null
        git_tag: null
```

---

## Rollforward

**To restore to the previous state:**

```bash
# Checkout to previous commit
git checkout <previous-commit-hash>

# Or if you know the tag
git checkout 2l-plan-1-iter-5

# Then restore config manually or use git
git checkout HEAD -- .2L/config.yaml
```

**Git preserves all commits and tags**, so rollback is non-destructive.

---

## Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Iteration Failed Badly
```bash
# Iteration 5 broke everything
/2l-rollback 4

# Review what went wrong
# Fix the plan or requirements
# Re-run iteration 5 fresh
/2l-next
```

### Use Case 2: Trying Different Approaches
```bash
# Completed iteration 3 with approach A
# Want to try approach B instead

/2l-rollback 2
# Modify plan for iteration 3
/2l-next  # Execute iteration 3 with new approach
```

### Use Case 3: Demo at Specific Checkpoint
```bash
# Need to demo at iteration 2 state
/2l-rollback 2

# After demo, return to latest
git checkout main
```

---

## Integration with Other Commands

### After Rollback

**To advance forward again:**
```bash
/2l-next    # Execute next iteration from rollback point
```

**To see current state:**
```bash
/2l-status  # Shows rolled-back iteration as current
```

**To list iterations:**
```bash
/2l-list-iterations  # Shows archived iterations
```

---

## Error Handling

**If git is dirty:**
```
‚ùå Working directory has uncommitted changes.
Commit or stash first.
```

**If iteration doesn't exist:**
```
‚ùå Iteration 10 not found.
Available: 1-7
```

**If already at target:**
```
‚ÑπÔ∏è  Already at iteration 5.
No action needed.
```

**If git checkout fails:**
```
‚ùå Git checkout failed
Check for conflicts or uncommitted changes.
```

---

## Prerequisites

- Clean git working directory (no uncommitted changes)
- Target iteration must have a git tag (created by auto-commit)
- `.2L/config.yaml` exists
- `yq` installed for YAML manipulation

---

## Notes

- **Non-destructive:** All commits and tags are preserved
- **Reversible:** Can rollforward using git checkout
- **Safe:** Validates git state before proceeding
- **Atomic:** Either completes fully or fails safely

---

**Remember:** Rollback is time travel within your project's development timeline. All history is preserved in git.
