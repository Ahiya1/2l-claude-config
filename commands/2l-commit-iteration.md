# 2L Commit Iteration - Force Commit Despite Validation

Manually commit the current iteration even if validation failed or hasn't run yet.

## Usage

```bash
/2l-commit-iteration
```

**With custom message:**
```bash
/2l-commit-iteration "Manual commit: partial completion"
```

---

## What This Does

Creates a git commit and tag for the current iteration:

1. Stages all changes
2. Creates commit with 2L metadata
3. Creates git tag: `2l-plan-{N}-iter-{M}`
4. Updates config with commit hash and tag
5. Marks iteration as COMPLETE (even if validation failed)

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING:** This bypasses validation. Use with caution.

---

## When to Use This

### Valid Use Cases:
- ‚úÖ Validation failed on minor issues, but you want a checkpoint
- ‚úÖ Partial completion of iteration (documenting progress)
- ‚úÖ Testing the commit system
- ‚úÖ Creating recovery points during development

### Invalid Use Cases:
- ‚ùå Avoiding fixing bugs
- ‚ùå Rushing past critical errors
- ‚ùå Breaking the build intentionally

## Example Workflow

### Scenario 1: Partial Completion Checkpoint

```bash
# Working on iteration 3
# Made good progress but validation fails on minor issues
# Want to checkpoint before continuing

/2l-commit-iteration "WIP: Core features complete, styling remaining"

# Creates commit and tag
# Can continue work and fix styling later
# Can rollback to this point if needed
```

### Scenario 2: Testing Iteration System

```bash
# Testing the 2L workflow
# Don't want to wait for full validation

/2l-commit-iteration "Test commit"

# Quickly creates checkpoint
# Can iterate on workflow
```

### Scenario 3: Validation Blocked on External Issue

```bash
# Iteration complete
# Validation fails because external API is down
# Not a code issue

/2l-commit-iteration "Iteration complete - validation blocked by external API"

# Commits anyway
# Can re-validate later when API is up
```

---

## What Gets Committed

**All changes in working directory:**
- Staged files
- Unstaged files
- New untracked files

**Exception:** Files in `.gitignore` are still ignored.

---

## Comparison with Auto-Commit

| Aspect | Auto-Commit (Orchestrator) | Force-Commit (Manual) |
|--------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| **Trigger** | Validation PASS | User command |
| **Validation** | Required | Bypassed |
| **Use case** | Normal flow | Override/checkpoint |
| **Status in commit** | PASS | FORCE_COMMITTED |
| **Safety** | High | User responsibility |

---

## Safety Considerations

### This Command:
- ‚úÖ Creates permanent git commit
- ‚úÖ Marks iteration as COMPLETE
- ‚úÖ Bypasses validation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è May commit broken code
- ‚ö†Ô∏è May commit incomplete features

### Use Responsibly:
- Document reason in commit message
- Fix issues before continuing
- Don't rely on force-commit as normal workflow

---

## Error Handling

**If not a git repository:**
```
‚ùå Not a git repository
Initialize git first: git init
```

**If no active iteration:**
```
‚ùå No active plan or iteration
```

**If no changes:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  No changes to commit

Create empty commit anyway? (y/N):
```

**If already committed:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  Iteration already committed with tag: 2l-plan-1-iter-3

Re-commit anyway? This will update the tag. (y/N):
```

---

## Integration with Other Commands

**After force-commit:**
```bash
/2l-status          # Shows iteration as COMPLETE
/2l-next            # Advance to next iteration
/2l-list-iterations # Shows force-committed iteration
```

**Checking force-committed iterations:**
```bash
git log --oneline | grep "FORCE_COMMITTED"
```

---

## Recovery

If you force-committed bad code:

```bash
# Rollback to previous iteration
/2l-rollback 2

# Or reset the commit (before pushing)
git reset HEAD~1

# Or amend the commit
git add .
git commit --amend
```

---

## Prerequisites

- Git repository initialized
- Active plan and iteration
- Working directory (clean or dirty - both work)

---

## Notes

- **Use sparingly:** Force-commit is an escape hatch, not normal workflow
- **Document why:** Always provide reason in commit message
- **Fix before continuing:** Don't build on broken foundations
- **Git preserves all:** Can always recover or revert

---

**Remember:** With great power comes great responsibility. Force-commit bypasses safety checks - use wisely.
